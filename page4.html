    <a class="Weaponbox"><h4>Bishen OV-4</h4>
    A successful Guesan made sniper rifle that was made to modernize their army. The Bishen OV-4 has an integrated suppressor meaning that it is extremely quiet, and on top of that, it shoots subsonic ammunition, making a gun silent up to the point where the guns mechanisms can be heard when firing. This is likely meant for covert special operations mission where not being detected by the enemy is paramount. This design seems to have originated from the Vetala Y88-S, but has been extensively modified with subsonic ammunition and it now has a very low recoil.</a>
    <p class="DamageAmmo">Damage: 85 in missions and 72 in versus, 10x multiplier in missions and 1x in versus</p>
    <p class="DamageAmmo">Ammo: 20 in every mag, 3 reserved mags</p>
    <p class="DamageAmmo">RPM: 200</p>
    <p class="DamageAmmo">Night vision: Allows better vision in dark areas. Toggled using V.</p>
    <p class="DamageAmmo">You have a lot of ammo so don`t worry about saving it.</p>
