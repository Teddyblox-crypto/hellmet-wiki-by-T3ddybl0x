 Republic of Nusia is one of 3 nations in HELLMET. The main characters, Aradus, Kaska, and Calar are Nusians.

In the events of HELLMET, the Republic of Nusia is at war with Guesans rebels after they had annexed Imperial Guesa, eventually bringing it to war with the Dominians during the events of HELLMET's older, horde-shooter sister game, Dummies vs Noobs. Nusia has a population of approximately 260 million.

<p class="Text"><img class="img1" src="https://static.wikitide.net/hellmetwiki/thumb/b/b8/Flag_of_Guesa.png/600px-Flag_of_Guesa.png">The Imperial Guesa was one of 3 nations in HELLMET. It is where majority of the events of HELLMET takes place.

Before the events of HELLMET, the Republic of Nusia successfully annexed Guesa. Becoming a puppet state for Nusia, named the Autonomous Administrative Republic of Guesa. Several independence movements (most notably The Guesan Independance Movement) were formed and in an attempt to free their country they created an army called the Guesan Liberation Army, said Army was assisted by a Dominian PMC called the White Coast Royal Security. By the end of HELLMET the conflict raged on for several years before a formal agreement is settled between the Guesan Independence Movement and the Republic of Nusia following extreme public pressure to end the war. Guesa would be semi-autonomous and function as a self-governing province, but would still respond to federal requests by the Nusian government. A majority of these federal requests would be the ownership of Guesan steel refineries, for the production of heavily armoured vehicles and shields.

The Guesan Imperial Army also appears as an upcoming PvP Faction, but as Remnants named "Imperial Army Remnants" or IAR for short rather then standard soldiers. May be caused from the dissolution of army during the Second Guesan Civil War.</p>
<p class="Text"><img class="img1" src="https://static.wikitide.net/hellmetwiki/thumb/a/ac/Flag_of_Pinzhao.png/600px-Flag_of_Pinzhao.png">The Dominion of Pinzhao (Dominian: 拼兗國; romanised: pìnzhào sù), also known as Dominia, is one of 3 nations in HELLMET. It is where the PMC, known as White Coast Royal Security (WCRS), originates. The Dominion of Pinzhao plays an important role as the covert backer of the Guesan remnants in HELLMET.

During HELLMET, The Dominion of Pinzhao functions as the main supporter of the Guesan cause, funding their freedom-fighting operations via transacting ammunition and money from offshore accounts, as seen on Test Place. They house the WCRS and (possibly) directly control it (however, it is unknown if the WCRS is willingly working with the Guesan movement due to the Dominion government sending it in or if they are contracted). It is also speculated that WCRS agents potentially smuggled the Guesan royal family to a diplomatic safe house somewhere in the Dominion of Pinzhao, but some say they were assassinated or kidnapped by them.</p>
