<h2>Versus</h2>
<a class="Text2">Two teams face off against each other in a map. One team receives thumb drives which they have to insert into a computer to win while the other team must defuse the process. Once the data is fully downloaded, the team who inserted it wins. However, both teams can also kill all enemy players to win. Alternatively, the defending team will win if a USB stick is not planted at a laptop site before the round timer ends.</a>
<p class="Text">The maximum number of players on each team is <a class="Sencored">5</a>. <a class="Sencored">There must be at least two players</a> in a server to play. (One player on each team at least)</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="Sencored">+600XP when winning and +300XP</a> when losing</li>
<li><a class="Sencored">+₱600 when winning</a> and +₱1100 when losing</li>
<li>+₱650 for every kill when winning, <a class="Sencored">+₱900 for every kill when losing</a>, +₱250 more for every kill using a hardcore weapon, which are the Hammer and Model 1888.</li>
<li><a class="Sencored">+₱300 for every player difference at the beginning of a round.</a> (+₱300 if the enemy team has 1 more player than your team, +₱600 if 2 more, etc.)</li></ul>
