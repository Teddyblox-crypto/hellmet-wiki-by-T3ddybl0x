<h2>Sessions</h2>
<h3 id="#Sessions">Foundation</h3>
This mission is meant to serve as a tutorial for new HELLMET players, introducing <a class="Sencored">vital gameplay mechanics and controls.</a> Notably, it is the only <a class="Sencored">solo</a> mission currently present within HELLMET.<img class="img1"src="https://static.wikitide.net/hellmetwiki/thumb/3/3b/Foundation.png/599px-Foundation.png">
<h3>Decovenant</h3>
Game description: It has been around <a class="Sencored">2 days</a> since the assault failed and the army left me and <a class="Sencored">Calar</a> here.
 We've run out of food, water, but we still have our fighting spirit.
  Our uniforms and weapons have deteriorated, but we managed to steal some guns, fresh clothes, and other <a class="Sencored">gizmos</a> we might need.
We've also found some guy nearby, apparently in a room just around this place.
 He's a bit weird but I'm sure he'd be a great addition to this ragtag team.
The plan is to find a <a class="Sencored">new radio</a>, call for help, and destroy the <a class="Sencored">anti-air radar</a> installations on the roof.
 I don't think we'll make it out, but it's better than dying here.

 <h3>DawnBreaker</h3>
 <p>Game description: This decrepit wreck was once a fully operational spice treatment plant. One day, a fire broke out and the building was shut down for health concerns. The authorities never bothered to revisit this place... until now.

We've seen report of increased insurgent activity here and our intel shows they're attempting to restart spice production for sale on the black market. That ends today.

You and your squadmates have proven yourselves more than capable in the Juilent Hospital just a day ago, so we're confident you can handle this mission well.

Good luck, Fireteam 6.</p>

<h3>Convergence</h3>
<p>Game description: Our new friend <a class="Sencored">Xinan</a> has helpfully provided us intel regarding Zho's whereabouts. Working with the NSC's intelligence branch leads us here, in the middle of a Dominian rural town. We've bribed some of the radar operators to let us through, so don't worry about being shot down.

We've previously sent Fireteam 1 in, but we lost contact with them. Highcom thinks they're dead, but I'm insisting they're still somewhere here. Because of them, you'll be taking a separate entry.

It should also be noted that there's a high level of WCRS activity here. Don't worry too much about the cleanup, our guys at the NSC will handle coverup operations. As always, drinks are waiting.</p>
